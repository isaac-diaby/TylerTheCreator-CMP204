          JavaScript and CSS are located in their folders too called "js" and "css" respectively. The components folder
          have some template files that I use to inject into the main page files. Lastly, PHP requests endpoints are in
          the "api" folder. </td>

        <td>A clear use of HTML5.</td>
        <td>I used HTML5 throughout the application so I included the "!doctype html" on all of the root pages. This
          allows me to take advantage of HTML5 features such as asynchronous JS, cookies, DOM manipulation and much
          more.</td>

          layouts using safari as it was the most accessible for me.</td>

          cookie that checks if the user has seen the cookie policy pop up on the first visit. If it's the user's first
          visit the application will show a delayed popup about the sites T&c.</td>

          function also automatically hashes the given password before hashing the password so I took advantage of that
          by adding the cost of 10, this is an option on the password_hash function.</td>

          server. in addition to escaping malicious inputs, I also used prepared statements with all user-provided data
          when executing SQL commands</td>
